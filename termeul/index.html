<time datetime=$creationDateMachine>2024-12-19</time></p><p>Termeul is the name of the theme for this website.
<a href=https://github.com/JoogsWasTaken/termeul>You can check it out on GitHub.</a></p><p>The name consists of &ldquo;term&rdquo;, short for &ldquo;terminal&rdquo;, and &ldquo;eul&rdquo;, which is the German word for &ldquo;owl&rdquo; but with the last letter missing.
Termeul is pronounced like &ldquo;turmoil&rdquo; which aptly describes the creation process of this theme.</p><h2 id=owlspace>Owlspace</h2><p>It all started in 2020 when I first wanted to share my thoughts with the whole world.
Owlspace was the name of my first proper domain that I used to express myself.
At the time, I was still a cybersecurity student.
I published writeups of challenges from TryHackMe and HackTheBox and the occasional technical write-up of things I found fascinating.</p><p><img src=owlspace.png alt="Screenshot of the &ldquo;Owlspace&rdquo; website"></p><p>In the process of researching my setup, I stumbled upon <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> which is the static site generator that I use to this day.
None of the premade themes appealed to me so I set out on the quest to design my own.
Given that I was still in university, I had plenty of time to add all the bells and whistles that I wanted back then.</p><p>The website received a lot of traction due to my <a href=https://eulenbu.de/posts/tg-nearby/>Telegram &ldquo;People Nearby&rdquo; writeup</a>, my <a href=https://eulenbu.de/posts/steam-login/>Steam login writeup</a> and the cute owl at the bottom of the page that you could pet.
Unfortunately, due to a lot of changes in my personal life and unforeseen struggles, I abandoned Owlspace as well as the theme which was starting to break because I didn&rsquo;t have the time nor the energy to fix it.</p><h2 id=eulenbude-in-space>Eulenbude in space</h2><p>At the end of 2022, I finally found myself with spare time on my hands.
Having finished my master thesis, I suddenly had more material to publish, but I had already announced my departure from Owlspace.
Reviving the old domain felt weird, so I got the Eulenbude domain which literally translates to &ldquo;owl booth&rdquo; and has the .de-TLD as part of its name which felt cool &mdash; and it still does!</p><p><img src=eulenbude.png alt="Screenshot of the &ldquo;Eulenbude&rdquo; website"></p><p>I wanted to keep the charm of Owlspace but keep the effort of theming minimal.
So I manually crafted the main page that is hosted on the homepage to replicate the magic of Owlspace and used a premade Hugo theme for my actual writings which were hosted on a separate subdomain.
This blog used the <a href=https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal>Terminal theme</a>.</p><p><img src=eulenbude-in-space.png alt="Screenshot of the &ldquo;Eulenbude in Space&rdquo; website"></p><p>I was never completely satisfied with this setup because suddenly I had two separate websites to tend to.
While Terminal is an amazing theme for the type of content that I publish, it didn&rsquo;t feel very cohesive given the design of the main site.
And to be completely fair, I wasn&rsquo;t happy with the main site as well because it was hastily put together and I made the maintenance of this site harder on myself by rolling my own static site generation.</p><h2 id=eulenbude-as-it-should-be>Eulenbude, as it should be</h2><p>Third time&rsquo;s the charm, and it was clear to me that I wanted a custom theme again to pin down the look and feel that I want my personal website to have.
However, I didn&rsquo;t want to go overboard with the theming, so I made a list of requirements.</p><ul><li>White text on a dark background for contrast and legibility</li><li>Main page with personal info and a brief main menu</li><li>No external dependencies (CDNs in particular)</li><li>Functional even when JavaScript is disabled</li><li>Keep the stars in the background and the pettable owl</li></ul><p>I drew a lot of inspiration and ground work from the <a href=https://github.com/joeroe/risotto>Risotto theme</a>.
With some minor modifications to its typography, layout and sizes, I had a solid skeleton to apply my own design choices to.
I also love that it keeps the management of its stylesheets simple instead of using Hugo&rsquo;s built-in pipelines which, while amazing, require a lot more fiddling.
This lifted a lot of the ground work that comes with crafing a cohesive theme off my shoulders.</p><p><img src=risotto.png alt="Screenshot of the &ldquo;Risotto&rdquo; theme"></p><p>On the old Eulenbude homepage, I had a simple repeating background that moves along as you scroll.
With Termeul, there&rsquo;s now multiple layers, more colors and a parallax effect as you scroll to give the website more visual depth.
If the background doesn&rsquo;t scroll on your device, then it&rsquo;s because the theme honors the user&rsquo;s preferences for reduced motion.
This also applies to the owl at the bottom of the page now.
<a href=https://typeof.net/Iosevka/>Iosevka</a>, which is the typeface for this website, has also been optimized for faster loading times.</p><p>Personally, I&rsquo;m very happy with how Termeul turned out.
It uses very few templates, has a great overall look and is based on the work of awesome people who know a lot more about crafting good themes than I do.
You can install it like any other Hugo theme by <a href="https://github.com/JoogsWasTaken/termeul?tab=readme-ov-file#install">following the instructions in the Termeul repository</a>.</p></div></main><footer class=page-footer><hr><nav class="nav nav-footer"><ul><li class=li-no-marker><a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></li><li><a href=https://eulenbu.de/impressum>Impressum</a></li></ul></nav></footer><div class=page-owl><div class=owl><input type=button class=owl-btn value="Pat the owl"><div class=owl-counter>&#9829; &#215; <span class=owl-counter-value>1,337</span></div></div></div></div><script src=https://eulenbu.de/js/background.js></script><script src=https://eulenbu.de/js/custom.js></script></body></html>
